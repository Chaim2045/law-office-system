## Logo Setup

To add your law office logo to the client reports:

1. **Prepare your logo file:**
   - Recommended format: PNG with transparent background
   - Recommended size: 300x200 pixels (will be resized automatically)
   - File name must be: `logo.png`

2. **Add the logo file:**
   - Place your logo file in this directory: `master-admin-panel/assets/logo.png`

3. **The logo will appear:**
   - Top left corner of all client reports
   - Automatically sized to fit (max 120x80px on screen, 100x60px on print)
   - If logo file is missing, it will gracefully hide without breaking the report

## File Structure
```
master-admin-panel/
└── assets/
    ├── logo.png        (your logo file - add this)
    └── README.md       (this file)
```

---

**Note:** The logo display is automatic once you add the file. No code changes needed!
